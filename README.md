# internship analysing pressures from host immune systems upon distinctive mutation patterns in the evolutionary history of viruses

Under the current COVID-19 pandemic, we have come across an unexpected level of illness and death, and the global economic and social disruption is equally catastrophic. What’s worse, like all viruses, the virus that causes COVID-19 -- SARS-CoV-2 changes over time. Most mutations are synonymous which don’t change virus’ proteins. However, some changes are non-synonymous, which means they can change the binding with lymphocytes to the virus then cause a viral escape, increase its spreading speed or the associated disease severity, eventually the effectiveness of vaccines. <br/> <br/>
As one of the most effective measures to control the spread of this pandemic, scientists have confirmed that the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines is decreasing while facing one of the most contagious variants – Delta, which is due to the rapid viral evolution under pressures from host immune systems. And with the high level of transmission, mutated viruses are likely to continue to escape. Therefore, this process has drawn our attention and brought out the principal question of this internship: __do pressures from host immune systems lead to distinctive mutation patterns in the evolutionary history of viruses?__ <br/> <br/>

Here I present to you my internship project, with the full code in the notebook named `H1N1_NS1_protein_clustering.ipynb`, along with the full internship report named `internship report.pdf` containing more details. The data used is contained in the fasta file `H1N1_NS1_protein.fasta`.
